For this project I will be practicing HTML concepts I have learned by building a basic recipe website.

After completing the project, I found that building barebone HTML files was really fun. I like that I can make any type of page that I want and customize it to my liking. I can see how I'll be able to become more creative with the more tools and concepts I'll learn. Though they are simple pages, I learned to have a blast with links, images, ordered lists, unordered lists and the general HTML lay out. 

I can't wait to continue learning! :)
